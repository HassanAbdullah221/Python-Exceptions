# Python-Exceptions

Learn how to raise and handle exceptions.

Explore five common Python exceptions.

Practice using assert to check conditions.

Part 1 – Raising Exceptions

Write a program that asks the user for their age.

If the age is negative, raise a ValueError with a custom message.

Part 2 – Handling Exceptions

Extend your previous program.

Use a try / except block to catch the error and display a friendly message.

Part 3 – Five Exceptions

For each case, write code that causes the exception and then handle it:

ZeroDivisionError → divide a number by zero.

TypeError → try adding a string and a number.

IndexError → access an element outside the list range.

KeyError → access a dictionary with a missing key.

ValueError → convert a non-numeric string to an integer.

Part 4 – Using assert

Ask the user for a number.

Use assert to check that the number is positive.

If the condition fails, show an error message.

Deliverables

One Python file (exceptions_lab.py) with all tasks.

Each part should be clearly separated with comments.

At the end, write a short note: Which exception do you think programmers encounter most often? Why?

✨ Bonus (optional):
Write a function that takes a list of numbers and:

Raises an exception if the list is empty.

Handles the exception and prints "List cannot be empty!".
